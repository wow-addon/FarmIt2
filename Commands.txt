    Change the visual scale of the currency bar, in decimal format: 1.25 = 125%.

group {add|remove}

  add
    Adds a new bar (there is a limit of 24 bars total). 
	New bars start with 12 buttons (4 of them showing) with a limit of 48 buttons per bar.

  remove {#}
    Followed by the bar number of the button group you wish to delete. 
    This permanently destroys the group and all of its buttons!
    
    If no bar number is given, the last bar that was created (highest number) will be deleted.

  list
    Prints a list of all existing bar ID's. Useful if you have hidden individual bars.


size {#} {#}

  Set the total number of buttons available on a given bar. There is a limit of 48 buttons per bar.
  For example: '/farmit size 1 10' would configure bar number one to have ten total buttons available on it. 
  Setting a bar to a smaller size will permanently delete any extra buttons.
  To simply hide some button spaces on a bar without destroying them, 
  click on the 'quick size' buttons (+/-) on the bar anchor.


grow {#} {L|R|U|D}

  Controls the direction that a button group grows: (L)eft, (R)ight, (U)p, (D)own
  For example: '/farmit grow 1 R' sets bar #1 to horizontal mode, growing to the right.


style {default|minimal}

  Choose a visual style (requires UI reload):
    'default' is meant to match the stock WoW interface.
    'minimal' is a clean look that goes better with addons like Bartender.

  If you feel adventurous, you can edit FarmIt2_Style.lua to add your own graphical themes.

  save {#} {name}

  Only use this if you are having problems with saved data like templates, etc. 
  WARNING: This will wipe out all your bars, preferences, and saved templates!
